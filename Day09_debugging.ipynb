    "For this exercise, assume the tags are well-formed (i.e. no malformed tags) and that there are no attributes in the tags. You only need to hands opening and closing tags such as `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<div>`, and their corresponding closing tags like `</html>`, `</body>`, and `</div>`. \n",

    "1. Initialize an empty stack.\n",

    "    - If you encounter an opening tag (e.g., `<div>`), push it onto the stack.\n",
    "    - If you encounter a closing tag (e.g., `</div>`), check if it matches the tag on top of the stack.\n",
    "        - If it matches, `pop()` the stack.\n",
    "        - If it doesn't match, the HTML is invalid.\n",
    "3. At the end, if the stack is empty, the HTML tags are properly matched. If the stack is not empty, some tags were not properly closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some starter code. \n",
    "\n",
    "> For now, we can ignore the `tags = re.findall(r'</?\\w+>', html)`, it's basically a regular expression that finds HTML tags for us and returns them as a list. "
